fifteen_puzzle.py
-----------------
15-puzzle solver derived from the 8-puzzle (eight_puzzle.py).

FifteenPuzzle inherits ALL logic from the Puzzle base class:
  - A* search
  - h1
  - h2 
  - h3
  - Random state generation
  - Benchmarking

The ONLY changes from the 8-puzzle are:
  - SIZE = 4  (4x4 grid instead of 3x3)
  - GOAL    (15 tiles instead of 8)
